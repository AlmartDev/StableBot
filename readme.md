# StableBot
### Overview

StableBot, a self-balancing robot project built using a MegaPi MeAuriga V1.3 (and arduino...), MPU6050 built in gyroscope, and PID control. This project aims to create a robot that can autonomously balance itself on two wheels using sensor data and precise control algorithms.

### Features

- Self-balancing functionality using a PID controller.
- Real-time angle measurement using MPU6050 gyroscope sensor.
- Adjustable PID parameters for fine-tuning the balance.
- Compatibility with Arduino boards and common components.

### Compiling

I did it in visual studio code but might be much easier to compile it in the Arduino IDE, make sure to install all required libraries and check your wiring! (pretty easy if using a megapi)
